# event_card

## 1. UI
  The UI for the card was taken from [here](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/spker-conference-event-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/24269923?_ga=2.11833143.2084173669.1637590605-1865471595.1637590605).
## 2. Styling
  The styling for this project was done completely in SCSS, being one the best CSS preprocessor there is in the market. Media query and flexbox are used nicely for its responsiveness.
